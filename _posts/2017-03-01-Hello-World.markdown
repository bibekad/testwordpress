Have you ever wondered how many ___languages___ are there in which you can actually display anything in your browser. If you have ever searched about ___languages___ used for making websites, you know there are many ___languages___, _frontend_, _backend_, lets not go in all those. In this article I am writing about the types by which you can write `Hello World` in browser. If we start writing all, it would be like a day just to read all those, but I will be writing the most popular ones.<br>
<ol>
<li> HTML</li>
Even if you do not know anything about making websites, then also you must have known about HTML, and how to write Hello World in it, you just have to simply type hello world in a .html extension file, save it and run it in a browser. There is no need of applying any code in html to write anhything.<br>
<li> Javascript</li>
JavaScript is the one of the most popular way of making a dynamic website. We can write Hello World in two different ways, 1st to write something in document, and next to write something in a alert box.{% highlight ruby %}<!-- document.write("Hello World");
alert("Hello World");
 !--> {% endhighlight %}
<li> Java</li>
Java is yet another highly popular and widely used language that you can consider for web development. This language is an object-oriented, class-based and concurrent language. Although I have not used much programming languages to write in browser. But writing Hello World is not a big problem.
{%highlight ruby %}
System.out.printIn("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}
<li> Python </li>
Python is a highly used and all-purpose programming language which is dynamic in nature. Being dynamic in nature means that you as a developer can write and run the code without the need of a compiler.
{% highlight ruby %}
print ("Hello World");
{% endhighlight %}
<li>PHP</li>
PHP is a Hypertext Processor, PHP is the most commonly used programming language for making websites. Even websites like facebook, wordpress, and Digg were made using PHP, to print Hello World in php we have two methods, echo and print
{% highlight ruby %}
<?php print "Hello World";
echo "Hello World";
?>
{% endhighlight %}
<li>Ruby</li>
I have not understood much about Ruby, but I know it can be used as a language to make websites, and program its function. But as i said earlier, printing Hello World is not a big problem for any of the language.
{% highlight ruby %}
print "Hello World\n"
{% endhighlight %}
<li>C++</li>
C++ is a console level language, the first object oriented language. To understand further languages, knowing C++ is a very important thing as per my teacher,lets print Hello World in C++
{% highlight ruby %}
cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
{% endhighlight %}
<li>C Language</li>
C is subject oriented language. It is one of the most basic languages. It offers building elements for other languages like C++, Python, Java and others. Printing hello world in C is ont of the simplest things that you will ever do.
{% highlight ruby %}
printf("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}
</ol>
`Programming` languages like C, C++ and some other require header files, without which the print statement does not work. So before trying any of them, we should check what header files are required and how to print them in our browser.
